# CannonGame
UCSD Extension: Android Programming
The CannonGame app challenges you to destroy targets before the time limit expires. The game consists of four types of visual components; a cannon, cannonball, targets, and a blocker that defends the targets. You aim and fire the cannon by touching the screen; the cannon then aims at the touched point and fires the cannonball in a straight line in that direction.\
- The app has nine levels. In each level, the target should have the same number of target pieces as the level.\
- When the cannonball hits the blocker, increase the blocker length.\
